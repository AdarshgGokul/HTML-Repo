       <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila is a historic fort in the Old Delhi neighbourhood of Delhi, India,
         that historically served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors.
         Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12th May 1638,
         when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi.</p>
